### **Key Elements**:

- **Purpose**:  
  _"It’s all about recovery—staying clean, attending meetings, and creating stability. This isn’t about finding a job right away; it’s about getting yourself back on track."_
- **Expectations**:  
  Residents must follow house rules—no drugs, no weapons, no fighting—and commit to recovery by attending meetings and participating in chores.  
  _"You’re expected to follow the rules, focus on recovery, and contribute to the house."_

- **Fees, Not Rent**:  
  Residents pay a **program fee**, not rent.  
  _"This isn’t just housing. It’s a recovery program. You’re paying for structure, accountability, and the opportunity to rebuild your life."_

- **Government Support**:  
  Initial costs are often covered by government programs, allowing residents to focus solely on recovery for the first two months.  
  _"The government usually covers those first two months so people can stabilize without worrying about money."_

### **What Residents Must Do**:

1. **Sign a Contract**:

   - _"Everyone signs a contract when they move in. It’s a sober living contract, not a rental agreement. The contract outlines the rules, the expectations, and what it means to be part of the program."_
   - This agreement includes commitments to sobriety, attendance at meetings, and adherence to house rules.

2. **Attend Meetings**:

   - _"You’ve got to go to meetings. That’s mandatory. Meetings keep you focused on recovery and help you stay accountable to yourself and others."_

3. **Stay Clean and Drug-Free**:

   - _"No drugs, no alcohol, no exceptions. You’re here to get clean and stay clean, and that’s non-negotiable."_

4. **Follow House Rules**:

   - _"There’s no fighting, no weapons, no bringing people over. Everyone has to follow the rules to keep the house safe and stable."_
   - Other rules include curfews, participation in house chores, and general respect for others in the program.

5. **Contribute to the Program**:

   - _"Everyone has responsibilities in the house—chores, cleaning, and maintaining the space. It’s part of creating a community and taking responsibility."_

6. **Focus on Recovery First**:

   - _"For the first couple of months, it’s all about recovery. We don’t want people worrying about jobs right away. The goal is to stabilize and build healthy habits."_

7. **Respect Accountability**:
   - _"If someone isn’t following the rules or relapses, they can’t stay. This is about keeping everyone safe and focused on recovery."_
