## **Jacob's House Structure & Vision**

1. **Purpose**:

   - A sober living program focused on helping individuals transition back into society by providing structured environments and accountability.
   - Serves as a "last house on the block," offering opportunities for rebuilding life.

2. **Three-Tier Structure**:

   - **Transition Housing**: For individuals starting recovery; focus is 100% on recovery, job-hunting, and attending meetings. Rules are strict and government funding typically supports initial costs.
   - **Sober Living**: Less restrictive but still with curfews, house meetings, and chores. Managed by a house manager.
   - **Advanced Living**: Minimal rules; tenants must apply and meet specific criteria such as six months of clean living and positive contributions. Residents vote on new members.

3. **Goals**:
   - Provide employment opportunities (e.g., landscaping, seasonal jobs).
   - Expand to include housing for women and mothers with children, offering family-friendly accommodations and unique programs.

### **Current Operations**

1. **Akron House**:

   - Located at 728 Kenmore Blvd.
   - 4 bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms, finished attic, and basement.
   - Currently accommodates five residents, including the house manager.
   - Has helped approximately 45-50 people over four years.

2. **Rules and Fees**:

   - Program fee structure: $135/week for private rooms in advanced living; shared rooms in sober living cost less.
   - Contracts emphasize program participation (meetings, sobriety, no drugs/weapons) rather than traditional rental agreements.

3. **Impact**:

   - Has had notable successes, with several residents maintaining long-term sobriety and stability.

4. **Challenges**:
   - Legal and bureaucratic obstacles due to city policies, including issues with eviction processes and being treated as a housing business instead of a recovery program.
   - Instances of relapse among residents and ensuring a safe environment for others in the house.

### **Expansion Plans**

- Plans for additional properties to include:
  - Housing for women and children.
  - Enhanced job training and stable employment options for residents.
  - Programs aimed at reducing dependency on government support while providing structure.

### **Legal and Operational Challenges**

1. **City Discrimination**:

   - Akron officials misunderstand Jacob's House as a residence rather than a business, leading to conflicts over tenant laws versus program rules.
   - Plans to pursue legal action to clarify the program's status.

2. **Maintaining Safety**:

   - Evictions for residents who relapse or threaten the environment are sometimes hindered by legal delays.
   - The program works to balance individual recovery with community safety.

3. **Perception and Funding**:
   - Currently relies on word-of-mouth referrals.
   - Limited advertising or outreach efforts, though plans to use websites with SEO and analytics.

### **Personal Insights from Jason**

- Jason credits sober living for saving his life and providing accountability that allowed him to thrive.
- He expresses frustration with systemic issues but remains committed to expanding the program to help others.

   - His experience gives him a unique understanding of what individuals in recovery need: stability, community, and opportunities to rebuild their confidence and independence.

   - He believes in the power of second chances and wants to help others see they can thrive with the right environment and support.
   - For Jason, this is not just about housing—it's about offering a foundation for personal growth, accountability, and community.

1. **Providing Stability and Structure**:

   - Jason’s sober living model ensures residents follow clear rules, focus on recovery, and rebuild their lives in a safe environment. This includes curfews, chores, and mandatory meetings.

2. **Recurrent Support**:

---

### **Challenges and Those He Couldn’t Reach**

1. **Relapse Cases**:

     - A group of three residents relapsed together within a week and had to be removed to protect the house's environment.
     - Of the three, two went to rehab, but one tragically passed away.

3. **Hard Decisions**:
   - Jason has had to turn people away who didn’t meet the program’s criteria or weren’t ready to commit to recovery. While this protects the house’s environment, it’s a painful reminder that not everyone can be helped immediately.

---

### **Key Testimonials**

2. **Residents’ Gratitude**:

3. **Broader Impact**:
   - Even individuals who didn’t stay clean for long acknowledge that Jacob’s House gave them an opportunity they wouldn’t have had elsewhere.

---

### **Big Picture**

- **Challenges**: Addiction is complex, and not everyone can be reached. Jason recognizes the difficulty in helping those who aren’t ready to change but remains committed to offering support where it’s needed.

# ---

### **The Core Problem: A Lack of Support for Recovering Addicts**

1. **The Transition Gap**:

   - "Without sober living, I wouldn't be alive."  
     Jason emphasizes that many recovering addicts complete rehab only to find themselves without structure, support, or stability. This lack of a "next step" often leads to relapse.

2. **Safety and Stability**:

   - "The last house on the block—nobody else will take them."  
     Jason describes his homes as a sanctuary for people who have nowhere else to turn. He provides an environment where they can escape the chaos and rebuild their lives safely.

3. **Accountability**:
   - "It's not just about having a roof; it's about accountability and structure."  
     Many programs fail to hold individuals accountable for their actions or provide the discipline needed for long-term recovery. Jason's houses enforce rules, routines, and community standards that encourage self-discipline and growth.

---

### **The Bigger Picture: Breaking the Toxic Cycle**

1. **Relapse and Community Impact**:

   - "Drugs aren’t the problem. It’s how people perceive life."  
     Jason believes addiction is a symptom of deeper issues, such as a lack of purpose or self-worth. By addressing these root causes, he aims to break the cycle of addiction.

2. **Reducing Harm to Society**:

   - "It’s helping the cops too because it’s keeping people off the streets."  
     Without sober living programs, individuals often relapse into behaviors that harm themselves and the community. Jason’s approach helps reduce homelessness, crime, and strain on public resources.

3. **The System’s Failure**:
   - "Akron is the birthplace of AA, but they fight me every step of the way."  
     Jason points out that systemic barriers, like misunderstandings about sober living homes and discriminatory city policies, hinder his ability to help. He fights these obstacles to protect his residents and his mission.

---

### **Who He’s Fighting For**

1. **Individuals in Recovery**:

   - "These people just need a chance to prove they can thrive."  
     Jason focuses on people who might have burned bridges elsewhere but are still willing to try. He offers them a safe place to heal and rebuild.

2. **The Most Vulnerable**:

   - "I want to start housing for women with kids. Nobody else will take them."  
     He recognizes that certain groups, like mothers with children, face unique barriers and wants to create spaces that cater to their needs.

3. **Future Success Stories**:
   - "I’ve had two guys come through my house who are still clean today. That’s what matters."  
     Jason sees the value in even a few lives being changed and uses these successes as proof that his model works.

---

### **In Summary**:

Jason is trying to solve the **lack of transitional support for recovering addicts**, ensuring they have a safe, structured environment to rebuild their lives. His goal is not just sobriety but to help people regain their confidence, stability, and ability to contribute to society. He’s also addressing systemic failures that make this work unnecessarily difficult, fighting for recognition of sober living homes as a vital part of recovery.

# ---

### **Business Case**

1. **Addressing a Critical Gap in Recovery**:

   - **The Problem**: After completing rehab, many individuals lack the structure, stability, and accountability needed to sustain recovery, leading to high relapse rates.
   - **Jacob’s House Solution**: Provides a tiered housing model (transition, sober living, advanced living) designed to support individuals at various stages of recovery, fostering long-term success.

2. **Cost-Effective Recovery Support**:

   - **Public Savings**: By keeping individuals in a structured environment, the program reduces costs associated with homelessness, emergency medical care, crime, and law enforcement.
   - **Private Model**: Operates as a self-sustaining business through program fees rather than relying on continuous public funding, minimizing taxpayer burden.

3. **Scalable and Sustainable**:

   - The model is replicable and can be expanded to other locations or demographics, such as women with children or specialized groups.
   - Offers flexibility to adapt to market demands, such as providing employment opportunities or tailored programming.

4. **Legal and Operational Innovation**:
   - Jason’s program operates under a business model that emphasizes contracts and program fees rather than traditional tenancy laws. This innovative approach ensures greater control over maintaining a safe and focused environment for residents.

---

3. **Potential for Growth**:
   - Expansion to additional homes and specialized populations increases the venture’s reach, revenue, and societal impact.

### **1. Additional Plans and Vision**

- **Women and Children Housing**:
  - Jason mentioned a future goal of creating housing for women with children, which would include family-friendly accommodations.
  - He acknowledged that these homes would require different financial arrangements (likely higher program fees) but could benefit from government assistance due to the unique challenges faced by mothers in recovery.
- **Children's Involvement**:
  - Jason envisions providing full rooms for mothers and their kids, ensuring the housing is supportive but not a "shelter" environment. This is meant to provide safety and a sense of dignity while maintaining structure.

---

### **2. Challenges with Bureaucracy**

- **Legal and Government Barriers**:

  - Jason detailed significant issues with the city of Akron, specifically with misunderstandings around sober living homes and tenant rights.
  - He’s had conflicts with the prosecutor’s office, where officials treated residents as tenants rather than participants in a recovery program. This created legal challenges in removing individuals who were disruptive or violating house rules.
  - Jason sees this as discriminatory and even mentioned consulting a lawyer about taking legal action to clarify the distinction between his program and standard housing.

- **Eviction Issues**:
  - Jason described frustrating situations where residents who relapsed or caused harm couldn’t be immediately removed due to tenant laws, which jeopardized the safety and stability of the house.

---

### **3. Operational Insights**

- **Program Fee Model**:

  - Jason clarified that residents pay a "program fee," not rent, to avoid classification as traditional housing. This distinction allows him to maintain stricter rules and enforce contracts aligned with recovery goals.

- **Housing Details**:

  - The Akron house, located at 728 Kenmore Blvd., has four bedrooms, 1.5 baths, a finished attic, and a basement. It currently houses five people, including the house manager.
  - He emphasized the affordability of his fees compared to standard living expenses, making the program accessible for those in recovery.

- **Employment Opportunities**:
  - Jason reiterated his plan to create jobs for residents, starting with landscaping and construction, which may evolve into other industries as the program grows.

---

### **4. Personal Philosophy**

- **Recovery Philosophy**:

  - Jason believes addiction is not the root problem but rather a symptom of deeper issues, such as negative perceptions of life and oneself. He sees his program as a way to address these underlying problems by providing stability and accountability.

- **Empathy and Experience**:
  - Jason spoke candidly about his own struggles and how sober living saved his life. This personal experience shapes his approach and drives his commitment to helping others.

---

### **5. Personal and Family Dynamics**

- **Family Involvement**:

  - Jason shared some personal anecdotes about balancing his recovery work with family life, including co-parenting and dealing with custody issues.

- **Emotional Ties to the Work**:
  - He expressed frustration at systemic obstacles but remains focused on helping individuals who genuinely want to recover.

---

### **6. Broader Social Observations**

- **Community and Police**:

  - Jason mentioned mixed experiences with law enforcement. While individual officers have expressed appreciation for his work, the "upper levels" of authority have created obstacles, highlighting systemic disconnects.

- **Challenges of Helping Others**:
  - Jason recognized the limitations of his work, noting that not everyone can be saved, especially if they’re not ready to commit to recovery. However, he remains focused on creating opportunities for those who are willing to try.

---

### **Potential Gaps or Follow-Up Questions**

- **Program Metrics**: While we know the program has helped 45-50 people, it would be helpful to have more specifics on success rates, duration of stay, or testimonials for promotional materials.
- **Details on New Ventures**: The vision for women’s and children’s housing is compelling, but specifics about timelines, funding, or property acquisition are unclear.
- **Scalability**: How does Jason envision expanding the model to other cities or demographics? Are there specific goals or barriers he anticipates?

# ---

### **Step 1: Establish Proper Financial Tracking**

1. **Open a Dedicated Bank Account**:

   - If he hasn’t already, Jason should open a business bank account for **Jacob’s House**.
   - Use this account exclusively for program fees, operational expenses, and other transactions. This keeps personal and business finances separate, which is essential for transparency and compliance.

2. **Adopt Accounting Software**:

   - Use software like **QuickBooks**, **Wave**, or **FreshBooks** to:
     - Track income and expenses automatically.
     - Generate invoices and receipts for residents.
     - Maintain digital records of all transactions.

3. **Implement a Cash Log**:
   - For cash payments, Jason should:
     - Keep a **cash receipt book** to document who paid, how much, and for what.
     - Deposit cash into the business account regularly, rather than holding it separately or using it immediately.

---

### **Step 2: Streamline Income Collection**

1. **Transition Away from Cash**:

   - Encourage residents to pay through traceable methods like checks, Venmo (business accounts), PayPal, or direct deposit.
   - While cash might feel easier, digital payments are easier to track and create an automatic paper trail.

2. **Issue Receipts**:
   - Always provide receipts for any payment received, whether cash or digital, to create mutual accountability and transparency.

---

### **Step 3: Organize Records for Tax Compliance**

1. **Maintain Detailed Records**:

   - Jason should keep the following for at least 7 years (the IRS audit window):
     - Program fee payments.
     - Expense receipts (utilities, maintenance, supplies, etc.).
     - Documentation of cash payments (receipts, cash logs).
   - Use categories in the accounting software to track operational costs, such as housing upkeep, employee wages (if applicable), and other expenditures.

2. **Set Aside Taxes**:
   - Calculate estimated quarterly taxes based on the program fees collected.
   - Use a separate savings account to set aside funds for taxes to avoid scrambling at the end of the year.

---

### **Step 4: Prepare for Transparency and Growth**

1. **Minimize Under-the-Table Practices**:

   - While Jason may have relied on informal transactions to avoid taxes, it’s critical to transition toward full transparency. This builds trust and avoids potential penalties down the road.
   - Being diligent about taxes and financial records will make it easier to transition to a nonprofit and apply for grants or donations in the future.

2. **Build a Financial Narrative**:
   - Document how program fees are reinvested into the program (e.g., house maintenance, utilities, resident support).
   - Tracking these reinvestments not only prepares him for future nonprofit status but also creates a compelling case for support when seeking donors or partnerships.

---

### **Step 5: Engage a Professional**

1. **Hire an Accountant or Bookkeeper**:

   - An accountant familiar with small businesses or transitional housing programs can:
     - Help Jason organize his finances and prepare taxes.
     - Identify potential deductions (e.g., utilities, property repairs, supplies).
     - Ensure compliance with local and federal tax laws.

2. **Consult a Tax Professional**:
   - A tax professional can also help Jason strategize on how to move away from under-the-table practices and gradually shift toward full compliance without causing financial strain.

---

### **Benefits of Diligence**

1. **Avoid Legal Risks**:

   - Keeping proper records and declaring all income protects Jason from audits or penalties.

2. **Enable Nonprofit Transition**:

   - A transparent financial history will make it much easier to apply for **501(c)(3)** status in the future, as nonprofits must provide clear evidence of how funds are used.

3. **Attract Partnerships**:

   - Organizations, donors, and governments are more likely to support a program with well-documented financial practices.

4. **Peace of Mind**:
   - With organized finances, Jason can focus more on the mission of Jacob’s House rather than worrying about tax issues or misplaced funds.

---

### Immediate Steps for Jason

1. Open a dedicated business bank account and deposit all program fees there.
2. Start tracking income and expenses using accounting software or a professional bookkeeper.
3. Transition residents to digital payments or checks to reduce reliance on cash.
4. Regularly consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and plan for the future.
