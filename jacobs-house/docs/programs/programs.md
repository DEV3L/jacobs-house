## **A Path to Recovery, Tailored to Your Needs**

At Jacob’s House, we understand that recovery is a journey. That’s why we’ve designed a **three-phase housing model** that meets individuals where they are in their recovery process. From **Transition Housing** to **Advanced Living**, our programs provide the structure, support, and accountability needed to rebuild lives.
